# Supabase Authentication Setup

## Disable Email Confirmation for Instant Registration

To fix the authentication issue and allow users to register without email confirmation, follow these steps in your Supabase dashboard:

### Step 1: Access Authentication Settings

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Providers** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Configure Email Provider

1. Click on **Email** provider
2. Find the setting **"Confirm email"**
3. **DISABLE** the "Confirm email" toggle
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Configure Site URL (Important!)

1. Navigate to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
2. Set the **Site URL** to your production domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com` or the Bolt.new URL)
3. Add **Redirect URLs**:
   - `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback`
   - `https://yourdomain.com/dashboard`
4. Click **Save**

### Alternative: Keep Email Confirmation BUT Fix Redirect

If you want to keep email confirmation enabled:

1. Keep "Confirm email" **ENABLED**
2. Make sure **Site URL** is set to your actual production URL (NOT localhost:3000)
3. Add your production domain to **Redirect URLs**

### What We've Fixed in the Code:

1. ✅ Added `detectSessionInUrl: true` to Supabase client configuration
2. ✅ Created `/auth/callback` route to handle email confirmations
3. ✅ Updated registration flow to handle both instant and confirmed registration
4. ✅ Added success/error messages for better user feedback
5. ✅ Improved error handling

### How It Works Now:

**With Email Confirmation Disabled:**
- User registers → Instant login → Redirects to dashboard
- No email needed, works immediately

**With Email Confirmation Enabled (after fixing Site URL):**
- User registers → Confirmation email sent
- User clicks link in email → Redirects to `/auth/callback`
- Session is established → Redirects to dashboard

## Recommended: Disable Email Confirmation

For the best user experience and based on your privacy policy (no sensitive data storage), we recommend **disabling email confirmation** entirely. This provides:

- Instant registration
- Better user experience
- No localhost redirect issues
- Matches your "no data storage" privacy approach

## Testing the Auth System

After making these changes:

1. Try registering a new user
2. You should be logged in immediately
3. No email confirmation required
4. Redirects straight to dashboard

## Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try in an incognito/private window
3. Check Supabase logs in Dashboard → Logs
4. Verify Site URL matches your production URL
